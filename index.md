## New Brunswick Bike Parking Inventory

This is Eric Yang's Final Project for Fall 2025 Command Line GIS:
An inventory of downtown New Brunswick's bike parking

I collected the bike parking data myself in a field audit, the demographic data is from the 2020 Census and the transit data is from NJGIN.

Here is an interactive map of the bike parking locations I documented:

Here are some of the static maps I created:
